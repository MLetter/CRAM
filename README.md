# CRAM
Run prediction.py, this will train the model and
then prompt you to answer some questions.
Answer these questions, be sure to follow the 
instructions for answers. When you see '(y/n)', 
make sure to type in either 'y' or 'n' in lower case.
If you see (integer), make sure you type in an integer
value. Once you've answered the questions, the machine
will tell you if you are at high, medium, or low risk
of mortality from COVID-19 based on your answers. 
It will then ask if you want to make another prediction.
If you type 'y', you will be able to make a new 
prediction without retraining the model. Typing 'n' 
will end the program and you will need to retrain the
model before making a new prediction by running 
prediction.py again.
